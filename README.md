# PointLines

This application is to demonstrate a duality between points and lines.

A *duality* is a function mapping one set of objects to another such that 
we preserve some key properties. The idea is, proofs of an invariant in one
space translate to invariants within the other, letting us gain traction on 
objects that are harder to reason about directly (lines) by working with points.
